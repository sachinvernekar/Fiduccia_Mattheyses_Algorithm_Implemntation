* This is a minor project related to the course work - VLSI Design and Automation

* This is a C++ implementation of Fiduccia Mattheyses Algorithm Implemntation.

* Here is the abstract: 
In all of the motivating applications for hypergraph partitioning, the size of input is grow-
ing and the demand for performance is high. The physical design methodology we apply to
these designs must scale to tens of millions of components today and hundreds of millions
in the foreseeable future. Because of these large inputs, any partitioning technique used
must have near-linear complexity in the worst case in order to be ective. State-of-the-art
partitioning tools use local search heuristics to rene a given partitioning solution. The
basic technique common to all VLSI partitioning applications is the Fiduccia Mattheyses
(FM) algorithm [1], which applies linear-time passes to iteratively improve a given parti-
tioning solution by moving every node exactly once. In our project, we have implemented
the 
at FM algorithm on C++.
